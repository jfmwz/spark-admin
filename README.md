# Features
* Automatically detect existing Spark clusters created by spark-ec2 script
* Create new Spark clusters with friendly hostnames
* Start/Stop/Terminate Spark clusters
* Start/Stop/Restart services on the cluster (Mesos, Spark, Shark, Ganglia, HDFS, MapReduce)
* Execute Shark SQL query on the fly

Put your Amazon private keys in the /keys directory under spark-admin. For example, if you want to create or manage clusters using `spark-key`, then copy `spark-key.pem` to /keys directory. Also remember to change all your .pem to mode `600` by using  

    chmod 600 spark-admin/keys/*.pem

Run spark-admin

    cd spark-admin
    python app.py

Then point your browser to `http://localhost:8888` and specify the Amazon credentials in the [Settings] menu

# FAQs

* **How to run Spark-Admin as background service?**

    You can run Spark-Admin as background service using command `nohup python app.py &` or via `supervisord`, but please notice that some features won't work properly such as: New cluster, Start cluster... due to problem in shell executing. Hopefully we can fix this annoying problem in the next version.

* **Where is web server log?**

    Please click on [Server Logs] in the GUI menu, or track it at `<spark-admin>/static/server.log`

* **I try to start Shark service, but nothing happens?**

    If you start Shark service on existing clusters created by spark-ec2 script, but not Spark-Admin, remember to open the port 10000 on the master for the Spark-Admin web server to talk to. Also starting Shark service may take a few seconds, then you can wait for around 5 seconds then refresh the page.
